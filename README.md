Use the basic command `magicat <image_name>` to identify what objects are contained in an image. If you have multiple images you'd like to inspect, you can also provide the name of a directory containing image files.

To scan a directory of images for a certain object, use the `--contains` command. When used in combination with the `--verbose` option, the results for all images in a directory will be displayed.

If you'd like to see an in-terminal preview of any of these objects, use the `--show` flag, followed by the name of the object you'd like to see. You can specify the 'colormap' to see all the objects highlighted within the original image.

To save any of the objects as individual image files, use the `--save` flag, followed by the name of the object you'd like to save, or use 'all' to save all objects.
